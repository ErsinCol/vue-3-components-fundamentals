## Build a Notification Vue Component

In the exercise, we'll be using [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), we'll specifically use the [message](https://semantic-ui.com/collections/message.html) element.

Your goal is to create a component that will be passed some content (the message) and the type of notification (info, error, success). The user should also be able to close the notification.
